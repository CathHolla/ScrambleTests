    "# Moving from words to sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the most basic thing we want to be able to do with more than just word-level information?\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose that natural language inference is a good domain to test for whether relational information between words is being used. Humans are good at it and give predictable answers to these questions, and they require concrete and tangible realtional information between words to get to the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets that require increasing amounts of non-local information\n",
    "\n",
    "Several tasks now are interested in sentence representations that go beyond bag-of-words. Sentiment analysis and paraphrase datasets go slightly above, but a lot of the performance of most models on these comes from word-level information. While sentence representations do outperform BOW on these, it is unclear exactly where they have improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language inference is a useful domain in which we can propose challenges that require increasingly complex compositionality and are therefore more diagnostic for what is being learnt and what isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present this set of datasets for natural language inference that humans perform predictably well on, and are impossible to capture from word-level information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a vocabulary\n",
    "We chose the SNLI dataset vocabulary, so that we could benchmark on the InferSent model that was trained end-to-end on natural language inference with this dataset. This assumes GloVe word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE : I haven't actually checked if these examples are within the vocab, but that's easy to do.\n"
